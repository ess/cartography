# Getting Started #

This chapter is all about doing the very first things that I do when staring this sort of project. It's not really about installing Python, setting up a new project space, or anything like that. More so, it's about what happens after all of those things.

The first step in the process, at least for me, is to take a look at whatever documentation may exist for the API that I'm trying to map to see if I can find some basic hints for its usage.
